Each post should have a queue/list of users who have just had the post shared to them in the most recent timestep.
    The timestep method should then iterate through the list of users for each post and give all receivers the chance
    to like the post/follow the OP.
    All new users who have the post shared to them (must ensure that followers do not already have the post shared to
    then) should either be added to the back of the user queue or be added to a new queue that then replaces the old one
    for the next timestep.

All users in the network were stored as strings as this made returning information from the input files far easier and
    because this method is far more resilient towards users being deleted between timesteps, which could cause many issues
    if posts were storing users as graph vertices.

Putting all post information on the post itself means posts can easily be added/deleted from the network at any point
    without actually interfering with the structure/functionality of the graph.

REALLY IMPORTANT:
    You messed up, there's one chance to like+share the post & another to follow the OP
