Each post should have a queue/list of users who have just had the post shared to them in the most recent timestep.
    The timestep method should then iterate through the list of users for each post and give all receivers the chance
    to like the post/follow the OP.
    All new users who have the post shared to them (must ensure that followers do not already have the post shared to
    then) should either be added to the back of the user queue or be added to a new queue that then replaces the old one
    for the next timestep.
